# InfoSecurity

party (test)

Found some projects for templating...They both would play a part in our app:

https://github.com/yyl/Tracking-map-on-android
https://github.com/robstoll/location-based-reminder

Moreso the 2nd link. It's location based reminder which is what were doing but instead of reminder it tells server were within a chat radius, and then if statement checking if Mac+radius encryption matches (aka in range, and mac is allowable into chatroom).

#Radius-based Chatroom Encryption (RBCE) [Use google locations (ie buildings, etc)]
#Open or Explicit (Name people, or add list).
